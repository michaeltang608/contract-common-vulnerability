# Background
By listing and reproducing common smart contract vulnerabilities, this project aims to rasise security awareness of developers and advised several ways to cirvumvent them.
Hardhat framework, ethers.js, openzeppelin and slither(automatic smart contract vulnerability scan) are adopted in this project.

#### Contract Test

```java
npm i  //install dependency
npx hardhat test ./test/xxx.js  //test specific contract

```

#### Contract Verification

````java
//install slither with docker
docker pull trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox 
docker run -it -v /home/share:/share trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox
  
//verify specific contract with slither
slither ./contracts/xxxx.sol
